Ingredients:
[1  1/2 c. Graham cracker crumbs
5   tbsp. Unsalted butter
1/4 c. Granulated sugar
4   c. Cream cheese
1   c. Granulated sugar
1   c. Sour cream
2   tsp. Lemon juice
3       Eggs] 

Instructions: 
[Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and pre-heat the oven to 350.

Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs, pour into a bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from oven and place on a large piece of aluminum foil, the foil will wrape around the pan for the water bath later. 

Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachement, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smoot hand creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs, one at a time.

Boil a pot of water. you need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foild around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust, smooth it out, and place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour in the hot water and place it in the oven.

Bake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. let the cheesecake sit in the oven (with it off and the door slightly open) for 1 hour. Then take it out of the water and unwrap it to cool at room temp. Once it's cool, cover it and let it cool for at least 4 hours or overnight.]
